# Web App Soursop Fruit Disease and Pest Detector
This is a thesis created during my college study in Iloilo Science and Technology University. This is a nano YOLOv8 model trained on a custom dataset containing Soursop Fruits that are healthy, with Anthracnose, and with Mealy Bugs infestation. The model has exhibited an accuracy of 88.9% and is deployed in a local web application using Flask.
